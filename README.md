# ZEIT3215 Lab 1

The 'lab1.ipynb' file contains most of the data processing operations I performed to produce the final figures in the report. The data needed to be processed because the window on the input signal was far too small resulting in frequency distortions in the FFT measurements. Additionally, the x scale on the Math FFT channel was not set properly, resulting in low resolution data acquisition for frequencies below 20 kHz (specified range)

## Issues with Plotly Browser Rendering

Viewing the notebook maybe challenging because github does not use a notebook renderer cable of rendering plotly figure objects properly. Plotly was used to generate interactive graphs, allowing for closer inspection.
